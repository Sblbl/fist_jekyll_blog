Hi!
I'm Marta Fioravanti, from the University of Pisa, Italy (I'm in online Erasmus from my house in Lucca). I have a background in Design and Visual Communication. I love illustrating concepts (scribing) and working with data. [Here](https://www.instagram.com/nonlineare/) you can find some of my illustrations, while [here](https://sblbl.github.io/music-editor/) there is a little music editor that works with drawings, and [here](https://sblbl.github.io/sisterator/) a noun generator.

I also like to make [fingerboards](https://www.instagram.com/ufofingerboards/) in my free time.
